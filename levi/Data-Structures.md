Seven primitives:
1. string
2. number
3. boolean
4. undefined
5. null
6. object
7. function

## Object / Hash / Map ##


## Linear Data Structures ##

Array

Set

Stack
_Stack - > last in, first out (stacking dishes analogy)_

Queue
_Queue - > first in, first out_

Linked List
_Different from an array, mainly in memory management. LL can store in memory different pieces of data at various places in memory. An array stores the full array data together in memory._
- regular (data, next)
- double (data, next, prev)
- circular (linked in a circle)

Pass by reference vs pass by value
- Strings, numbers, null, undefined, boolean pass by value
- Objects and functions pass by reference

## Binary Trees ##
```
            15
        /        \
       3         17
     /   \     /    \
    1     6   16    20
```
    
Depth first search (searches all the way down the branch first)
Breadth first search (

## Matrix ##

An array containing an array (or more).

## Graph ##

A series of nodes. This data structure is free flowing compared to the binary tree structure.

       |-vertices
```
